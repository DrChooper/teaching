# Nexus Format Overview

## Introduction

The Nexus format is a widely used file format in phylogenetics and bioinformatics for representing sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, and associated metadata. It is designed to be flexible and can accommodate a variety of data types and structures.

## Structure

A Nexus file typically contains the following blocks:

### Header

The header specifies the file format and provides general metadata. It begins with the line:
```nexus
#NEXUS
```

### Data Block

The `DATA` block contains sequence alignments and other data. It includes dimensions of the dataset, data format specifications, and the actual sequence matrix.

**Example:**
```nexus
BEGIN DATA;
  DIMENSIONS NTAX=5 NCHAR=10;
  FORMAT DATATYPE=DNA MISSING=? GAP=-;
  MATRIX
    Species1   ACGTACGTAC
    Species2   ACGT-T-G-C
    Species3   ACGTAC-TAC
    Species4   -CGTACGT-C
    Species5   ACGTACGTAC
  ;
END DATA;
```

- `DIMENSIONS NTAX` specifies the number of taxa (sequences).
- `DIMENSIONS NCHAR` specifies the number of characters (columns in the alignment).
- `FORMAT` defines the datatype (e.g., DNA), missing data symbol, and gap symbol.
- `MATRIX` contains the alignment data where each row represents a sequence.

### Tree Block

The `TREES` block stores phylogenetic trees. It allows for the inclusion of multiple trees with various tree formats.

**Example:**
```nexus
BEGIN TREES;
  TREE tree1 = ((Species1, Species2), (Species3, (Species4, Species5)));
END TREES;
```

- `TREE tree1` specifies a tree with a given topology.
