Here's the annotation for the script:

```bash
while read -r id start end strand
do
    length=$((end - start + 1))
    modulus=$((length % 3))
    echo "$id $length $modulus"
done < rpoC2.tsv
```

### Annotation:

1. **`while read -r id start end strand`**: Reads each line from the file `rpoC2.tsv`, assigning values to variables `id`, `start`, `end`, and `strand`.

2. **`length=$((end - start + 1))`**: Calculates the length of a feature by subtracting the `start` position from the `end` position and adding 1. This accounts for the inclusive nature of positions.

3. **`modulus=$((length % 3))`**: Computes the remainder when the `length` is divided by 3. This helps in determining whether the length is a multiple of 3, which can be important for analyzing coding sequences.

4. **`echo "$id $length $modulus"`**: Outputs the `id`, `length`, and `modulus` of each feature to the standard output.

5. **`done < rpoC2.tsv`**: Ends the `while` loop after processing all lines in the `rpoC2.tsv` file.

This script calculates the length of features and their modulus when divided by 3, then outputs these values along with the feature ID.
