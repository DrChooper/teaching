When using Mashtree for tree construction, the parameters `kmer size` and `minhash sketch size` significantly influence the resulting tree's quality and accuracy. Here's a detailed explanation of how each parameter affects the tree:

### 1. **k-mer Size**

- **Definition**: The k-mer size is the length of the nucleotide sequence fragments (k-mers) used for comparison. For example, with a k-mer size of 16, the software breaks down sequences into overlapping segments of 16 nucleotides.

- **Effect on Tree Construction**:
  - **Resolution**: Larger k-mers (e.g., 16) provide higher resolution and specificity because they capture more detailed sequence information. This helps in distinguishing between closely related sequences and improving the accuracy of the tree.
  - **Data Size**: Larger k-mers generate fewer k-mers from a given sequence, potentially reducing the dataset's size but increasing the complexity of comparisons. Smaller k-mers, on the other hand, increase the number of k-mers, which can improve sensitivity but might lead to increased computational requirements.
  - **Noise**: Smaller k-mers may introduce more noise due to the higher likelihood of matching k-mers from unrelated sequences.

### 2. **Minhash Sketch Size**

- **Definition**: The minhash sketch size determines the number of hash functions used to create a minhash sketch of the k-mer set. For example, a sketch size of 100,000 means that the minhash representation will consist of 100,000 hash values.

- **Effect on Tree Construction**:
  - **Accuracy**: A larger sketch size improves the accuracy of similarity estimates by reducing the probability of collisions in the hash values, leading to more precise distance calculations between sequences.
  - **Computational Load**: Larger sketch sizes increase the computational resources required for processing, including memory and processing time. However, they enhance the overall fidelity of the resulting tree by providing more accurate similarity measures.
  - **Sensitivity**: With a larger sketch size, the software can more accurately capture the similarity between sequences, leading to a more reliable and nuanced tree structure.

### Example: Mashtree Command

```bash
mashtree("/mnt/s-ws/everyone/annotation/", 16, 100000)
```

- **`"/mnt/s-ws/everyone/annotation/"`**: Directory containing input sequences.
- **`16`**: k-mer size used for sequence comparison.
- **`100000`**: Minhash sketch size for similarity estimation.

### Summary

- **Larger k-mer Size**: Improves resolution and reduces noise, leading to more accurate trees but requires more computational power.
- **Larger Minhash Sketch Size**: Enhances accuracy of similarity measures and the tree's precision but increases computational demands.

Optimizing these parameters involves balancing between accuracy and computational efficiency based on the specific requirements of your analysis and dataset.
