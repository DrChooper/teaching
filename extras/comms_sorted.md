Here's an annotated breakdown of the command:

```bash
comm -3 <(cut -f 3 Av.geseq.txt | sort) <(cut -f 3 Av.chloe.txt | sort)
```

- `comm -3`: This command compares two sorted files line by line and outputs the lines that are unique to each file. The `-3` option suppresses lines that are common to both files, showing only the lines that differ between them.

- `<(cut -f 3 Av.geseq.txt | sort)`: This uses process substitution to create a temporary file-like stream containing the output of the following commands:
  - `cut -f 3 Av.geseq.txt`: Extracts the third column from `Av.geseq.txt`.
  - `sort`: Sorts the extracted column in ascending order.

- `<(cut -f 3 Av.chloe.txt | sort)`: Similarly, this creates another temporary file-like stream containing:
  - `cut -f 3 Av.chloe.txt`: Extracts the third column from `Av.chloe.txt`.
  - `sort`: Sorts this extracted column.

The `comm -3` command then compares the sorted lists from `Av.geseq.txt` and `Av.chloe.txt` and outputs:
- Lines that are unique to `Av.geseq.txt` (i.e., those found only in `Av.geseq.txt` but not in `Av.chloe.txt`).
- Lines that are unique to `Av.chloe.txt` (i.e., those found only in `Av.chloe.txt` but not in `Av.geseq.txt`).
