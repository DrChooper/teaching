Here's an annotation for the provided shell script snippet:

```bash
while read -r gene
do
    numgenes=$(grep "ID=$gene;Name=$gene" chloe/*.gff3 | wc -l)
    echo "$gene $numgenes" >> gene_numbers.txt
done < gene_names.txt
```

### Explanation:

1. **`while read -r gene`**:
   - **`while`**: Starts a loop that continues until the end of input.
   - **`read -r gene`**: Reads a line from the input (in this case, from `gene_names.txt`) into the variable `gene`. The `-r` option prevents backslashes from being interpreted as escape characters.

2. **`do`**:
   - Marks the beginning of the commands to be executed for each iteration of the loop.

3. **`numgenes=$(grep "ID=$gene;Name=$gene" chloe/*.gff3 | wc -l)`**:
   - **`grep "ID=$gene;Name=$gene" chloe/*.gff3`**: Searches for occurrences of the pattern `ID=$gene;Name=$gene` in all files with the `.gff3` extension within the `chloe` directory. This pattern is dynamically constructed using the value of `gene` from the current iteration of the loop.
   - **`|`**: Pipes the output of `grep` to the next command.
   - **`wc -l`**: Counts the number of lines in the input provided by `grep`. This effectively counts the number of occurrences of the pattern.
   - **`numgenes=$(...)`**: Assigns the result (number of occurrences) to the variable `numgenes`.

4. **`echo "$gene $numgenes" >> gene_numbers.txt`**:
   - **`echo "$gene $numgenes"`**: Prints the current gene name and its associated count.
   - **`>> gene_numbers.txt`**: Appends the output of the `echo` command to the file `gene_numbers.txt`. Each line in this file will consist of a gene name followed by the number of occurrences found.

5. **`done < gene_names.txt`**:
   - **`done`**: Marks the end of the `while` loop.
   - **`< gene_names.txt`**: Redirects the content of `gene_names.txt` as input to the `while` loop. Each line in `gene_names.txt` will be read into the variable `gene` one by one, and the loop will process each gene name.

### Summary:
This script reads each gene name from the `gene_names.txt` file, searches for occurrences of that gene in `.gff3` files within the `chloe` directory, counts the number of matches, and appends the gene name along with its count to the `gene_numbers.txt` file.
