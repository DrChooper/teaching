### Analysis of Results

The analysis below compares the variant data across three stages: the **original**, **cleaned**, and **filtered** datasets, focusing on key metrics such as `nHapRef`, `nHapAlt`, and `nMissing`.

#### **1. nRefHom (Reference Homozygous Sites)**
- **Original**: 0 for all samples
- **Cleaned**: 0 for all samples
- **Filtered**: 0 for all samples

Since chloroplast genomes are haploid, the `nRefHom` count is expected to be 0 in all cases. This consistent result across all datasets aligns with expectations.

#### **2. nNonRefHom (Non-Reference Homozygous Sites)**
- **Original**: 0 for all samples
- **Cleaned**: 0 for all samples
- **Filtered**: 0 for all samples

Similarly, `nNonRefHom` remains 0 across all samples, consistent with the haploid nature of the chloroplast genome.

#### **3. nHets (Heterozygous Sites)**
- **Original**: 0 for all samples
- **Cleaned**: 0 for all samples
- **Filtered**: 0 for all samples

Heterozygous sites are not expected in haploid organisms, so the consistent 0 values are expected.

#### **4. nHapRef (Haploid Reference Alleles)**
- **Original**: Higher values before cleaning, indicating potential contamination.
- **Cleaned**: Lower values, indicating the removal of contaminants.
- **Filtered**: Decreased further, indicating that high-quality variants still exhibit lower `nHapRef`.

The drop in `nHapRef` after cleaning reflects the removal of sequences that were incorrectly counted as reference alleles due to contamination. The subsequent filtering further refines this count, removing low-quality variants.

#### **5. nHapAlt (Haploid Alternate Alleles)**
- **Original**: Lower values, likely due to masking by contaminants.
- **Cleaned**: Increased values, indicating clearer identification of variants.
- **Filtered**: Decreased slightly, reflecting the retention of only high-quality variants.

The increase in `nHapAlt` after cleaning suggests that true variants became more apparent once the contaminating sequences were removed. The slight decrease in the filtered dataset indicates that only the most reliable variants were retained after quality filtering.

#### **6. nMissing (Missing Data Points)**
- **Original**: Varied across samples.
- **Cleaned**: Generally decreased, with some exceptions (e.g., sample 16).
- **Filtered**: Consistent with the cleaned dataset, indicating that high-quality variants were consistent with the cleaned dataset.

The cleaning process reduced the number of missing data points, leading to more complete and reliable datasets for downstream analysis. The filtered dataset retained this improvement.

### Conclusion
The `nHapRef` and `nHapAlt` metrics highlight the impact of contamination removal and quality filtering on the accuracy of variant calls. The reduction in `nHapRef` after cleaning and filtering suggests that many regions previously considered reference were likely due to contaminants. The increase in `nHapAlt` after cleaning, followed by a slight decrease after filtering, reflects the improved identification and refinement of true variants.
