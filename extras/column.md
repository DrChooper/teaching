Here's an annotation for the command:

```bash
sourcedir=/mnt/s-ws/everyone/annotation

cat $sourcedir/genome_metadata.tsv | column -t -s $'\t' | less -S
```

### Explanation:

1. **`sourcedir=/mnt/s-ws/everyone/annotation`**:
   - Sets the variable `sourcedir` to the path `/mnt/s-ws/everyone/annotation`, which contains the directory with the necessary files.

2. **`cat $sourcedir/genome_metadata.tsv`**:
   - Uses the `cat` command to output the contents of the file `genome_metadata.tsv` located in the directory specified by the `sourcedir` variable.

3. **`| column -t -s $'\t'`**:
   - **`|`**: Pipes the output of the `cat` command into the `column` command.
   - **`column -t`**: Formats the input into a table where columns are aligned. The `-t` option specifies that the input should be treated as a table.
   - **`-s $'\t'`**: Specifies the delimiter for columns, in this case, the tab character (`\t`), which is commonly used in TSV (Tab-Separated Values) files.

4. **`| less -S`**:
   - **`|`**: Pipes the formatted table output into the `less` command.
   - **`less -S`**: Opens the output in the `less` pager program, with the `-S` option which prevents line wrapping. This is useful for viewing wide tables where horizontal scrolling is necessary.

### Summary:
The command sequence reads the `genome_metadata.tsv` file from the specified directory, formats it into a neatly aligned table with tab-separated columns, and then displays it using `less` with horizontal scrolling enabled. This is helpful for reviewing the contents of the TSV file in a more readable format.
